 Antivirus Project

This is a lightweight and efficient antivirus software built with the aim of providing basic protection against malware, viruses, and other threats. The project is designed to detect and remove potential risks from files and directories by scanning them for known signatures, anomalies, and behaviors.

 Features:
- Signature-Based Scanning: Detects known viruses and malware by comparing files against a database of virus signatures.
- Heuristic Analysis: Analyzes the behavior of unknown programs to identify suspicious activity.
- Real-Time Protection: Monitors the system for any abnormal or potentially harmful behavior.
- Quarantine Mode: Isolates suspicious files to prevent them from harming the system.
- Customizable Scanning: Users can choose to scan specific directories or the entire system.

 Technologies Used:
- Python
- Regular Expressions
- File I/O
- Heuristic Algorithms
- SQLite (for database storage)
